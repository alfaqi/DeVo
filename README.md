# DeVo (Voting System)

The DeVo or Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based voting platform that aims to provide a secure and transparent way to conduct elections and voting processes. This system leverages blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of the voting process and eliminate fraud.

## Features

- **Voter Registration:** The system allows eligible voters to register securely, ensuring that only authorized individuals can participate.

- **Secure Voting:** Voters can cast their votes securely and privately using blockchain technology. Each vote is recorded on the blockchain, making it immutable and tamper-proof.

- **Transparency:** The entire voting process, including voter registration, ballot casting, and result tallying, is transparent and auditable on the blockchain.

- **Decentralization:** The system is decentralized, meaning that no single entity or authority has control over the voting process. This ensures trust and fairness in elections.

## Installation

To set up and run the DeVo locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfaqi/DeVo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd DeVo
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. **Voter Registration:**

   - New voters can register by providing their identity details and verifying their eligibility.
   - Once registered, voters receive a unique blockchain-based identity.

2. **Casting Votes:**

   - Registered voters can log in using their blockchain-based identity.
   - They can browse the list of available elections and cast their votes securely.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain:** The system is built on a blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum) for secure and transparent voting.

- **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts are used to manage voter registration and the voting process.
